# Abstract

We simultaneously examined structural and functional brain network patterns in relation to dimensions of psychopathology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset. We applied PCA on each imaging modality, and deployed PLS (partial least squares correlation analysis), a data-driven unsupervised machine learning technique to derive *latent components* linking psychopathology to brain imaging patterns. Several components were identified, recapitulating the psychopathology hierarchy, with the general psychopathology (p) factor explaining most covariance with multimodal imaging features, while the internalizing, externalizing, and neurodevelopmental dimensions were each associated with distinct morphological and functional connectivity signatures.
