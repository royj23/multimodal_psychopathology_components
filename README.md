# Background
We examined structural and functional brain patterns in relation to dimensions of psychopathology in 9-11 year old youth. We applied PCA on each imaging modality, and deployed PLS (partial least squares correlation analysis), a data-driven unsupervised machine learning technique to derive *latent components* linking psychopathology to brain imaging patterns.
Several components were identified, recapitulating the p factor, together with internalizing, externalizing, and neurodevelopmental dimensions, each associated with distinct morphological and functional connectivity signatures.
